# Prereq
- Install Git
- Use VSCode (highly reccomended)

# COMMON Commands

`git clone [url]` - clone a repository

`git pull` - get the latest changes

`git checkout [name of branch]` - look at a branch

`git branch [branch name]` - create a new branch (make sure to publish!)

`git add *` - add all files to commit

`git commit -m "message"` - commit new changes to repository

`git push` - push changes to remote server

# Merging to main
Just make a Pull Request on GitHub and follow the steps there.

# Advice
Always pull before push.

Work on separate files to avoid conflict.

Always communicate when you push your changes.
